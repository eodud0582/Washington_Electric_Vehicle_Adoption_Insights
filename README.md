Welcome to the **Washington State Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption Analysis** project! This dashboard provides a detailed analysis of EV adoption in Washington State, exploring its relationship with economic indicators, infrastructure development, and political factors.

This analysis is designed for:
- **Policymakers** looking to make informed decisions about EV promotion.
- **Industry stakeholders** seeking insights into market trends.
- **Researchers and other states** aiming to understand the key factors driving EV adoption.

## 1. Key Features
- **EV Adoption Overview**: Analyze the distribution of electric vehicles across Washington State. <!-- and compare it with other U.S. states -->
- **Economic Insights**: Understand how median household income relates to EV adoption rates.
- **Infrastructure Analysis**: Explore the relationship between EV adoption and the availability of charging infrastructure.
- **Political Landscape**: See how EV adoption correlates with political trends and legislative districts.
- **Customizable Filters**: Users can select different legislative districts for a more tailored analysis.
- **Chart Options**: Within some major topics, users can choose from various chart types to gain deeper insights.

## 2. How to Access the Dashboard

This dashboard has been deployed on **Streamlit** and is publicly accessible. You can view it by simply visiting the following link:

[https://evwash.streamlit.app](https://evwash.streamlit.app/)

## 3. How to Run the Dashboard Locally

This project is built with **Streamlit**, a tool that allows you to easily create interactive dashboards and web apps in Python. Follow these steps to run the dashboard locally on your machine.

### 1) Prerequisites

Python installed:
- Python 3.12.6

Packages installed:
- pandas 2.2.3
- numpy 1.26.4
- statsmodels 0.14.2
- plotly 5.24.1
- streamlit 1.38.0

### 2) Step-by-Step Instructions

<br>

**a) Clone the repository**
   
   First, clone this repository to your local machine:
   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/eodud0582/Washington_State_Electric_Vehicle_Adoption_Analysis.git
   cd Washington_State_Electric_Vehicle_Adoption_Analysis
   ```

**b) Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**
   
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

**c) Install required packages**
   
   The easiest way to install the necessary packages is by using the `requirements.txt` file::
   
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Alternatively, you can manually install the packages:

   ```
   pip install pandas==2.2.3 numpy==1.26.4 statsmodels==0.14.2 plotly==5.24.1 streamlit==1.38.0
   ```

**d) Download the data**
   
   Ensure the data files (`ev.pickle`, `ev_merged.pickle`, `ev_state.pickle`) are available in the `data_processed/` folder.
   If these files are not included in the repository due to size limits, you will need to manually download or provide these files.

**e) Run the Streamlit app**
   
   Once everything is set up, you can launch the Streamlit app by running the following command:

   ```
   streamlit run ev_analysis_streamlit.py
   ```

**f) Access the dashboard**
    
   After running the command, the Streamlit dashboard will automatically open in your browser on `http://localhost:8501`. Otherwise, a local URL will be provided in the terminal. Open that link in your browser to view and interact with the dashboard.

## 4. Data Sources

This dashboard leverages the following data:
- **Electric Vehicle Registrations by State**
- **Electric Vehicle Population Data (Washington)**
- **2022 Washington State Legislative Election Results**
- **Alternative Fuel Stations (Charging Stations)**
- **Median Household Income in the Past 12 Months (ACS 2022 5-year)**
- **Washington State Legislative Districts 2022 (Geospatial)**

These datasets have been cleaned, merged, and processed into the following variables:
